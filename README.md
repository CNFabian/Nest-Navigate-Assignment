## 🎯 Design Decisions & Assumptions

### User Experience Decisions
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Information is revealed step-by-step to avoid overwhelming users, especially first-time homebuyers who may feel intimidated by real estate concepts
- **Immediate Feedback**: Quiz answers provide instant feedback with explanations to reinforce learning and build confidence
- **Progress Visualization**: Multiple progress indicators help users understand their journey and maintain motivation
- **Mobile-First Design**: Assumed most users would access the platform on mobile devices, so prioritized mobile experience

### Technical Architecture Decisions
- **Component-Based Design**: Modular React components for maintainability and reusability across the larger Nest Navigate platform
- **State Management**: Chose React hooks over external libraries like Redux for simplicity, assuming the application scope would remain focused
- **Local Storage**: Implemented progress persistence assuming users might not have accounts initially but still want their progress saved
- **Tailwind CSS**: Selected for rapid development and consistent design system that could scale across multiple learning modules

### Gamification Strategy
- **Coin System**: 15 coins per correct answer to provide tangible rewards without being overly generous
- **Ranking System**: Designed 9 progressive ranks to give long-term goals beyond the initial 3-lesson module
- **Achievement Focus**: Emphasized completion and accuracy over speed to encourage thoughtful learning

### Content Assumptions
- **Lesson Length**: Kept lessons concise (estimated 5 minutes each) assuming busy homebuyers have limited attention spans
- **Difficulty Level**: Designed for complete beginners with no prior real estate knowledge
- **Question Format**: Used multiple choice exclusively for simplicity and clear right/wrong feedback



**Time Spent**: Approximately 6-8 hours  
**Focus Areas**: Clean code architecture, responsive design, user experience, and gamification elements
